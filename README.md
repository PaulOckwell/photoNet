### Simple Photography website using Materialize.

## Task
Create a simple website to get to grips with materialize and improve my web design skills.

## Criteria
- Be responsive on all midea types/sizes
- Look modorn and up to date
- Run smoohtly with fast loading times
- Have some added user fuctionality

## Summery of teck stack
I chose to build this webiste using materialize because i understand how powerful this framwork can be. Leaning how to use materialize would allow me to develoup bispoke websites in a greatly reduced time. This allows me to improve my web design skills at a much faster pace and to focus more of my time develouping using Javascipt. This is esspecally benificicial when building Web applications. 

## Functionality
Photo Net utilises plenty of Materializes functions. When clicked in the nav bar the page will scroll to the desierd section with a smooth transition. I also develouped parallaxes which makes images stationary when scrolling; this can be seen on large screens only. On the services section the images can be selected, this will make the image full screen to allow the user to have a better view. By the social icons on the top right I included a tooltip funciton, this fuction explains what the icon is linked to. Scrolling to the bottom of the website there is a contact form with a date selection tool, allowing users to book appointment/send email messages.  

## Design
With this simple design i took isperation from varioius online sources. Google images and pintrest being the main sources of influnce.
